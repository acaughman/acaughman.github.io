#### Santa Barbara Channel LTER

Starting during the summer of 2022, I will be participating in an acoustic telemetry study tagging lobster off the coast of Santa Barbara in the SBC LTER. The goal is to use movement data to test ecological theory about habitat use and animal movement.

I spent June 2021 in Mo'orea, French Polynesia at the Gump Station assisting Mark Hay's lab as a reserach technician. As part of my work I: 

* Collected samples of nudibranchs, sea hares, crabs, macroalgae, and turf algae.
