### Mo'orea Coral Reef LTER

I spent June 2021 in Mo'orea, French Polynesia at the Gump Station assisting Mark Hay's lab as a reserach technician. As part of my work I: 

* Collected samples of nudibranchs, sea hares, crabs, macroalgae, and turf algae. 
* Placed settlement panels and fertilizer on the reef. 
* Conducted feeding choice assays and flume chemical cue assays on nudibranchs, sea hares, and crabs.
* Preformed sea cucumber dissection for microbiome analysis of gut contents.
