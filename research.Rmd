### Marine Movement Ecology

#### Climate change, fishing, and marine protected area affects on marine species movement behavior

Research suggests that marine protected areas (MPAs) select for lower mobility in marine fish, including selects for low movement alleles, increased residency, and decreased home range sizes. While evolving to move less may be useful for conservation efforts and MPA effectiveness in the present, this could be detrimental in the face of climate change which will demand fish to move or die in conditions outside the thermal range they can handle. Here, I will attempt to simulate the combined selection pressures of climate change, fishing, and a MPA. This could have implications for MPA design, and if fishing pressure dominates trait evolution at low degrees of variability, MPAs may not be the best long-term conservation solutions for areas that have low climate variability. 

#### Predicting commercially relevant fish species movement traits

I developed a random forest model in order to predict home range and pelagic larval duration values for over 800 species of commercially relevant marine species. Data inputs were generated from an extensive literature review of empirical home range studies. The model was able to predict home range values of species within an order of magnitude almost 90% of the time. This model will be useful in the future for understanding how much space species utilize and for classifying groupings of movement characteristics in future efforts.
