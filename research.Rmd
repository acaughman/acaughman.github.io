### Disentangling drivers and impact of adult versus larval movement

Fish movement occurs across two distinct life-stages, larval and adult, that each have unique ecological environmental drivers dictating movement capacity. Although larval dispersal and adult movement are often considered individually, understanding how species traits and external drivers interact to determine overall combined movement capacity is key to fully understanding a fish’s movement capacity. Utilizing new data sets of predicted species movement characteristics (Bradley and Caughman et al., in Review), we shows that distinct factors drive movement extents at each life-stage (Rosenberg and Caughman, in prep), leading to specific environmental contexts where species evolve specific combined movement capacities. In a changing world, movement capability is a key factor for a species’ survival, determining both its level of protection within marine protected areas and its ability to track climate change. This work will help provide a more nuanced understanding of how life-stage specific species movement and combined movement capacities impact conservation design and climate tracking abilities.

I spent June 2021 in Mo'orea, French Polynesia at the Gump Station assisting Mark Hay's lab as a reserach technician. As part of my work I: 

* Collected samples of nudibranchs, sea hares, crabs, macroalgae, and turf algae.

* Placed settlement panels and fertilizer on the reef. 
* Conducted feeding choice assays and flume chemical cue assays on nudibranchs, sea hares, and crabs.
