### Marine Movement Ecology and Conservation

#### Interactions between protection and in climate change

Much is still not understood 

#### Understanding the role adult movement and larval disperal in MPA effectivness



#### Machine Learning in Movement Ecology



### Species Habitat Use and Distributions

#### Habitat Continuity at MPA boundaries and Spillover



#### Understanding the role of adult movement and larval dispersal in climate tracking



### Fisheries 

#### Determining boundaries globally for fish stocks

The goal of this project is to build a global spatial database of management boundaries for all countries and regional fishery management organizations (This is under contract for Mola Mola Analytics and FishSource). I hope to use these boundaries to inform fisheries management, such as determined the success of marine protected areas within these different management schemes.

#### Maching learning and Fisheries
