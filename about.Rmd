### Research Interests

I am largely interested in the affect of climate change and other pressures on species movement behaviors, such as home range sizes and dispersal ability/rate. I plan to first understand how climate change and fishing pressure interact to effect species home range and dispersal ability and then expand to include even more factors. 

 

### Hobbies

I spend most of my free time rock climbing at the Santa Barbara Rock Gym in downtown Santa Barbara. I also enjoy hiking, kayaking, SCUBA Diving and other outdoor activities!
