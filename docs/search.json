      "contents": "\r\nMarine Microbiology\r\nCoral Microbiomes\r\nLittle is known about the stability of coral microbiomes over hourly\r\nfluctuations in environmental conditions. For parameters such as\r\ntemperature and pH, the magnitude of day–night fluctuations can exceed\r\nthose observed in mean values over seasons, especially on shallow reefs.\r\nSuch short-term heterogeneity can affect longer term trends, possibly by\r\ninfluencing the extent to which corals acclimate to stress and increase\r\nresilience. We found significant, stochastic changes in both the\r\ncomposition and transcription of microbiome members of three coral\r\nspecies over a diel cycle. These patterns raise the possibility that\r\necological functions of the microbiome may vary substantially over\r\nhourly timescales, notably between day and night. Further studies are\r\nneeded to compare temporal change in the coral microbiome with that due\r\nto other factors, such as spatial distance within and among\r\ncolonies.\r\nClownfish Microbiomes\r\nWorking with Dr. Frank Stewart and Dr. Zoe Pratte at the Georgia\r\nInstitute of Technology, I collected skin microbiome samples from\r\nnumerous anemones and clownfish to determine if direct contact affected\r\nthe skin microbiome. This work was published in 2018 and found that\r\nclownfish skin microbiomes shifted significantly when in contact with an\r\nanenome, which has implications for how clownfish are able to avoid\r\ngetting stung by the sea anenomes.\r\nDiscipline\r\nBased Education\r\nResearch (DBER)\r\nStudent’s attitudes\r\ntowards math and CS\r\nQuantitative and computational skills are required of 21st-century\r\nbiologists. It is important to understand how students perceive math and\r\nCS subjects and whether those perceptions are linked or operate\r\ncontradictory to determine instructional best practices. We aimed to 1)\r\ndetermine biology students’ perceptions of math and CS in biological\r\ncontexts, 2) measure the linkage of those perceptions, and 3) examine\r\nadditional factors affecting attitudes. Math and CS values exhibited\r\npositive correlations, but Utility and Cost were more negative for CS,\r\nlargely made more positive by prior exposure to CS. Given these\r\nfindings, we make educational recommendations for CS and math exposure\r\nearly, often, and embedded in the biology curriculum.\r\nOther work\r\nWhile still at the Georgia Institute of Technology, I developed a\r\nSwirl Module in R for BIOS 2301, for the Ecology Lab at Georgia Tech.\r\nThis module walks students through analyzing stream health data from the\r\nEPA for streams across the United States using descriptive statistics,\r\nboxplots, and linear regression in R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nMarine Movement Ecology\r\nClimate\r\nchange, fishing, and marine protected area affects on marine species\r\nmovement behavior\r\nResearch suggests that marine protected areas (MPAs) select for lower\r\nmobility in marine fish, including selects for low movement alleles,\r\nincreased residency, and decreased home range sizes. While evolving to\r\nmove less may be useful for conservation efforts and MPA effectiveness\r\nin the present, this could be detrimental in the face of climate change\r\nwhich will demand fish to move or die in conditions outside the thermal\r\nrange they can handle. Here, I will attempt to simulate the combined\r\nselection pressures of climate change, fishing, and a MPA. This could\r\nhave implications for MPA design, and if fishing pressure dominates\r\ntrait evolution at low degrees of variability, MPAs may not be the best\r\nlong-term conservation solutions for areas that have low climate\r\nvariability.\r\nPredicting\r\ncommercially relevant fish species home ranges\r\nI developed a random forest model in order to predict home range and\r\npelagic larval duration values for over 800 species of commercially\r\nrelevant marine species. Data inputs were generated from an extensive\r\nliterature review of empirical home range studies. The model was able to\r\npredict home range values of species within an order of magnitude almost\r\n90% of the time. This model will be useful in the future for\r\nunderstanding how much space species utilize and for classifying\r\ngroupings of movement characteristics in future efforts.\r\nMarine species Habitat Use\r\nLobster\r\nhabitat use in and around marine protected areas\r\nThis study addresses mechanisms driving spillover (animal movement\r\nfrom within a marine protected area (MPA) into a fished area) of the\r\nCalifornia spiny lobster within the Campus Point State Marine\r\nConservation Area (SMCA). The Santa Barbara Channel Long-Term Ecological\r\nResearch program has conducted annual surveys of lobster abundance\r\nwithin the Campus Point SMCA since 2012. While these efforts have\r\ndemonstrated long-term increases in lobster abundance within the MPA,\r\nthey do not consider changes in lobster abundance immediately outside of\r\nthe reserve or relative to habitat configuration. To understand how\r\nhabitat influences lobster spillover, we will extend the current\r\nsampling in multiple locations in and around the MPA. Measuring the\r\nchanges in lobster abundances within and adjacent to the reserve will\r\nallow us to quantify the fishery benefits provided by the MPA and\r\nprovide recommendations for future MPA design to maximize such\r\nbenefits.\r\nUsing\r\nsonar to assess fish densities within kelp aquaculture farms\r\nSimilar to natural kelp forests, kelp farms and other forms of\r\naquaculture, such as fish and bivalve farms, increase abundance and\r\ndiversity of wild species due to habitat and food source provisioning.\r\nGiven this added structure, we predicted that fish will be attracted to\r\nkelp farms in higher abundances than surrounding areas. Here we aim to\r\nquantify changes in density of wild fish at and away from kelp farms\r\nusing sonar surveys in order to determine if aquaculture farms will have\r\na positive effect on wild fish populations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
