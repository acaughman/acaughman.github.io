I am largely interested in the affect of climate change and other pressures on species movement behaviors, such as home range sizes and dispersal ability/rate. I plan to first understand how climate change and fishing pressure interact to effect species home range and dispersal ability and then expand to include even more factors.\r\nI plan to leverage my existing programming skills to develop simulation models to answer a broach range of theoretical questions about species movement in climate change. Then, I hope to leverage empirical field experiments to test and improve the theoretical models and translate that into effective marine conservation solutions.\r\nHobbies\r\nI spend most of my free time rock climbing at the Santa Barbara Rock Gym in downtown Santa Barbara. I also enjoy hiking, kayaking, SCUBA Diving and other outdoor activities!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nMarine Microbiology\r\nCoral Microbiomes\r\nLittle is known about the stability of coral microbiomes over hourly fluctuations in environmental conditions. For parameters such as temperature and pH, the magnitude of day–night fluctuations can exceed those observed in mean values over seasons, especially on shallow reefs. Such short-term heterogeneity can affect longer term trends, possibly by influencing the extent to which corals acclimate to stress and increase resilience. We found significant, stochastic changes in both the composition and transcription of microbiome members of three coral species over a diel cycle. These patterns raise the possibility that ecological functions of the microbiome may vary substantially over hourly timescales, notably between day and night. Further studies are needed to compare temporal change in the coral microbiome with that due to other factors, such as spatial distance within and among colonies.\r\nClownfish Microbiomes\r\nWorking with Dr. Frank Stewart and Dr. Zoe Pratte at the Georgia Institute of Technology, I collected skin microbiome samples from numerous anemones and clownfish to determine if direct contact affected the skin microbiome. This work was published in 2018 and found that clownfish skin microbiomes shifted significantly when in contact with an anenome, which has implications for how clownfish are able to avoid getting stung by the sea anenomes.\r\nDiscipline Based Education Research (DBER)\r\nStudent’s attitudes towards math and CS\r\nQuantitative and computational skills are required of 21st-century biologists. It is important to understand how students perceive math and CS subjects and whether those perceptions are linked or operate contradictory to determine instructional best practices. We aimed to 1) determine biology students’ perceptions of math and CS in biological contexts, 2) measure the linkage of those perceptions, and 3) examine additional factors affecting attitudes. Math and CS values exhibited positive correlations, but Utility and Cost were more negative for CS, largely made more positive by prior exposure to CS. Given these findings, we make educational recommendations for CS and math exposure early, often, and embedded in the biology curriculum.\r\nOther work\r\nWhile still at the Georgia Institute of Technology, I developed a Swirl Module in R for BIOS 2301, for the Ecology Lab at Georgia Tech. This module walks students through analyzing stream health data from the EPA for streams across the United States using descriptive statistics, boxplots, and linear regression in R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nMarine Movement Ecology\r\nClimate change, fishing, and marine protected area affects on marine species movement behavior\r\nResearch suggests that marine protected areas (MPAs) select for lower mobility in marine fish, including selects for low movement alleles, increased residency, and decreased home range sizes. While evolving to move less may be useful for conservation efforts and MPA effectiveness in the present, this could be detrimental in the face of climate change which will demand fish to move or die in conditions outside the thermal range they can handle. Here, I will attempt to simulate the combined selection pressures of climate change, fishing, and a MPA. This could have implications for MPA design, and if fishing pressure dominates trait evolution at low degrees of variability, MPAs may not be the best long-term conservation solutions for areas that have low climate variability.\r\nPredicting commercially relevant fish species home ranges\r\nI developed a random forest model in order to predict home range values for over 800 species of commercially relevant marine species. Data inputs were generated from an extensive literature review of empirical home range studies. The model was able to predict home range values of species within an order of magnitude almost 90% of the time. This model will be useful in the future for understanding how much space species utilize and for classifying groupings of movement characteristics in future efforts.\r\nMarine species Habitat Use\r\nUsing sonar to assess fish densities within kelp aquaculture farms\r\nSimilar to natural kelp forests, kelp farms and other forms of aquaculture, such as fish and bivalve farms, increase abundance and diversity of wild species due to habitat and food source provisioning. Given this added structure, we predicted that fish will be attracted to kelp farms in higher abundances than surrounding areas. Here we aim to quantify changes in density of wild fish at and away from kelp farms using sonar surveys in order to determine if aquaculture farms will have a positive effect on wild fish populations.\r\nLobster habitat use in and around marine protected areas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
