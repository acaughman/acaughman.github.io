#### Bio

I am a PhD student in the [Bren School of Environmental Science and Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/) at the University of California, Santa Barbara advised by [Steve Gaines](https://bren.ucsb.edu/people/steve-gaines) and [Darcy Bradley](https://www.darcybradley.com/). 

During my time in the [Gaines Lab](https://gaineslabucsb.com/), I am interested in the intersection of marine animal movement ecology, conservation, and data science. I hope to further the understanding of how animals move in response to climate change and other pressures in order to best direct conservation efforts for important species and habitats. I plan to leverage my existing programming skills to develop simulation models to answer a broach range of theoretical questions about species movement and habitat choice. Then, I hope to leverage empirical field experiments to test and improve the theoretical models and translate that into effective marine conservation solutions. Currently, I am interested in how evolutionary changes and behavioral plasticity may affect species movement and dispersal behavior. I am currently supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellows Program.


I spend most of my free time rock climbing at the Santa Barbara Rock Gym in downtown Santa Barbara. I also enjoy hiking, kayaking, SCUBA Diving and other outdoor activities!
