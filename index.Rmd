I am a PhD student in the [Bren School of Environmental Science and Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/) at the University of California, Santa Barbara advised by [Steve Gaines](https://bren.ucsb.edu/people/steve-gaines) and [Darcy Bradley](https://www.darcybradley.com/). 

I am interested in the intersection of marine animal movement ecology, conservation, and data science. I hope to further understanding how animals move in response to climate change and other pressures in order to best direct conservation efforts for important species and habitats. I am particularly interested in mobile marine predators. I am currently supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellows Program.
